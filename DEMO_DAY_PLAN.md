# 🚨 DEMO DAY PLAN - 10 Hours to Go

**Current Time**: ~12:30 PM Wednesday
**Demo**: Saturday (3.5 days away)
**Today's Goal**: Get all critical features working

---

## 📊 PRIORITY MATRIX

### 🔴 CRITICAL (Must Have - 6 hours)
These MUST work for demo or it looks broken:

1. **Home Screen - "See All" Navigation** (30 min)
   - Link "See All" → Transaction History
   - Simple navigation fix

2. **Manual Expense Entry - End to End** (1 hour)
   - Verify form works completely
   - Test save → appears in list → persists
   - Fix any bugs

3. **Savings Goal - Edit** (1.5 hours)
   - Tap goal → Edit screen
   - Update saved amount
   - Save changes

4. **Savings Goal - Delete** (45 min)
   - Long press or swipe to delete
   - Confirmation dialog
   - Remove from storage

5. **Profile - Remove Subscription** (15 min)
   - Just hide/remove the UI element
   - Not needed for demo

---

### 🟡 IMPORTANT (Nice to Have - 3 hours)
These make the demo impressive but not critical:

6. **Analytics - Month-wise Activity** (1 hour)
   - Group transactions by month
   - Show bar chart
   - Can use mock data if needed

7. **Profile - Support/Feedback** (1 hour)
   - Simple form: Name, Email, Message, Rating
   - Save locally or show "Submitted" message
   - Doesn't need real backend

8. **Home Screen - Reminders/Alerts** (1 hour)
   - Show upcoming due dates
   - Can be mock data for demo
   - Just needs to look good

---

### 🟢 SKIP FOR NOW (Post-Demo)
These are too complex for 10 hours:

9. ❌ **Smart Savings Suggestions** - Too complex, keep mock data
10. ❌ **Profile Savings Settings** - Confusing scope, clarify after demo
11. ❌ **Monthly Savings Tracking** - Backend heavy, not critical

---

## ✂️ WHAT WE'RE CUTTING

1. **Smart Savings Suggestions** - Keep mock data, say "AI-powered (coming soon)"
2. **Profile Savings Settings** - Unclear requirement, skip for now
3. **Monthly Savings Tracking** - Too complex, focus on goals
4. **Backend for Support** - Just show success message

---

## 🚀 CONFIDENCE LEVEL

**Can we do this?** YES! ✅

**Why?**
- Critical items = 6 hours (we have 10)
- Most are UI changes, not complex logic
- Savings storage already works
- 4 hours buffer for bugs/testing

**Risk Areas:**
- Manual entry might have hidden bugs
- Analytics chart might be tricky
- Time management (stay focused!)

---

## 📝 EXECUTION RULES

1. **No Perfectionism** - Working > Perfect
2. **Test Immediately** - Don't wait till end
3. **Use Mock Data** - When backend is too slow
4. **Skip Validation** - Basic checks only
5. **Focus on Demo Flow** - Not every edge case

---
